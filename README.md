Hello ! This is the Caesar Key encrypter made for the problem set 2 of CS50's Introduction to Computer Science course.

The user should input the key in the command prompt after the ./caesar key (key as a number) command.

The software works as follows :

1 . Get the users input and checks if it's valid
2 . Assigns the key entered by the user to an integer
3 . Gets the plain text from the user
4 . Ciphers the text using Caesar's cipher method
5 . Prints back the ciphered text in result for the user.
